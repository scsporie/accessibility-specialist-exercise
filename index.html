            Welcome to the Accessibility Team's website assessment exercise. The goal of this exercise is to give us an
            idea of where you stand, in regards to your awareness of accessibility standards while assessing a website. Your objective is
            to evaluate how well the website linked below fits WCAG's accessibility standards. If you find any
            issues, note them. The goal is not for you to spend hours upon hours trying to find absolutely everything wrong with the site. A list of 
            <span style="color:red">the top five issues</span> noticed is sufficient. Use any and all tools available to you, then submit the finished report to the Accessibility Team. 
            Click the link below to access the website.
